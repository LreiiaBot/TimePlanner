                                                                                                                      - show time till deadline only of selected element => updated every second maybe

                                                                                                                      - maybe implement some cool graphics made with aseprite

                                                                                                                      - sometimes update for exapmle "task gets red when due" (on load calculate time till this happens, then start disptachertimer or something)

                                                                                                                      - maybe use frames ? i think they are called like this. For example Datagrid with TimeControlledElements just take it and put it in every window where it is needed

  - what do i want to display?

  - which windows?

  - is there a combobox to select a list which then shows all tasks of it? or the reminders?

  - The mainpage takes all reminders and sorts them. Then it shows them in this order

                                                                                                                      - default value file (json, xaml, csv, db?)

  - where to save all the reminders presented on the mainpage?

  - even lists have reminders, obviously they have to be managed aswell (think about old tasks, create new ones and so on)

  - how to add new tasks?
  ========================

    - it has to be fast! thats the point
    - is there a default list, where tasks are added?
    - is this done through a field on the mainwindow?

FEATURES / IDEAS
#################

  Affirmations / motivational sayings / life advice
  =======================================================

    - show at least one per day (random out of a list)

  Protocol
  =========

    - see when something is changed, added, removed, ... and from who, when and what

  Alarm
  ======

    - access windows alarm if possible, otherwise make a beep sound or so until user clicks "noticed"

  Mobile version
  ===============

    - synchronise pc and phone via tcp or something in network

  Diary function
  ===============

    - maybe it is not necessary to do something for this and its already doable with the lists and tasks (list with reminder every in the evening, task with no reminder)

  Labels?
  ========
